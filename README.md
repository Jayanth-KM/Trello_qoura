upGrad RESTful Web APIs (Social Q&amp;A web-app) Project

Problem Statement

Project Brief:- 
In this project, you will work on developing REST API endpoints of various functionalities required for a website (similar to Quora) from scratch. In order to observe the functionality of the endpoints, you will use the Swagger user interface and store the data in the PostgreSQL database. Also, the project has to be implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA).

 

This is a group project, you would be working in a group of 3 or 4 students and there would be one final submission. Use Git and GitHub to conduct version control of your assignment code throughout your assignment development.

As you have learnt in the version control module, it is a good software engineering practice to use version control while developing software.

In your submission, include a link to your GitHub repo that contains the course 5 project code.

Download the stub file provided below and work on the same file to implement the required API endpoints as per the given problem statement.
